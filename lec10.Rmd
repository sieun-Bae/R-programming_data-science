Histogram: breaks

```{r}
x <- sample(1:5, 100, replace=TRUE, prob = c(0.2,0.2,0.5,0.1,0.0))
hist(x, breaks = c(0,1,2,3,4,5))
```
```{r}
x <- seq(-pi, pi, 0.1)
plot(x, x^2, main="x squared from -pi to pi", type = "l", col="magenta")
```

```{r}
with(mtcars, plot(wt, mpg, main="Scatterplot example for mtcars", xlab="car Weight", ylab="Miles Per Gallon", pch=20, col="purple")) 
abline(h=mean(mtcars$mpg), col="orange")
